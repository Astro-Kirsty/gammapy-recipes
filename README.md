# Recipes

Prototype for a repository of notebooks.

- Recipes placed in ``recipes`` folder.
- Processing machinery done by ``scripts/processing.py``.
- Seamless community contribution as PRs of self-contained folders.
- Content Integration tests deployed as Github actions.
- Automated Sphinx built as a gallery of recipes.
- Links ``.ipynb`` and ``.py`` files.
- Low maintenance effort ([doc](https://www.iaa.csic.es/~jer/recipes/contributing.html))
